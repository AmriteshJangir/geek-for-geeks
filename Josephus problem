Question:
You are playing a game with n people standing in a circle, numbered from 1 to n. Starting from person 1, every kth person is eliminated in a circular fashion. The process continues until only one person remains.
Given integers n and k, return the position (1-based index) of the person who will survive.
Examples :
Input: n = 5, k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: Firstly, the person at position 2 is killed, then the person at position 4 is killed, then the person at position 1 is killed. 
Finally, the person at position 5 is killed. So the person at position 3 survives. 
Input: n = 7, k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The elimination order is 3 → 6 → 2 → 7 → 5 → 1, and the person at position 4 survives.
Constraints:
1 ≤ n, k ≤ 500

Solution:
class Solution {
    public int josephus(int n, int k) {
        // code here
        if(k == 1) return n;
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
            list.add(i);
        }
        return helper(0, list, k);
    }
    private int helper(int prev, List<Integer> list, int k){
        if(list.size() == 1) return list.get(0);
        List<Integer> curr = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 1; i <= list.size(); i++){
            prev++;
            if(prev == k){
                prev = 0;
                continue;
            }
            else{
                curr.add(list.get(i-1));
            }
        }
        return helper(prev, curr, k);
    }
}
